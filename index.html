          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Introduction of Community Partner and Research Question.</p>

          <p>This semester I have had the pleasure to work with Community Partner Sarah McCoy on data recently released by Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), in the hopes of helping to create valuable visualizations that help answer questions of environmental racism that pertain to solid waste and recycling in our state. Sarah McCoy is a member of The Center for Leadership and Justice, a non-profit organization centered around providing communities in Hartford with the skills and support necessary to organize social justice reforms in Hartford, and has worked closely with The Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance (GHIAA) in the past to answer questions like: where does our trash go? Who assess the level of pollution? And who will clean up the land after it is deemed unusable from unsustainable waste-disposal-practices? Since the passing of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1976 (when the slogan “reduce, reuse, and recycle” was created), many Americans have been buying into sustainable practices, like recycling, without understanding the full-scope of what is capable of being recycled and re-used into new material. All of these are important questions and considerations that motivate our amazing community partner(s), and my role in helping them better address these concerns is to answer the following: which Hartford area towns have a high percentage of recycling?</p>

          <p>This question is useful in helping them because DEEP has provided us with exclusive data on solid waste and recycling in Connecticut. Prior to this (the data released is from data from 2021), the last report available on this subject had not been updated since 2014, so there have been seven years where we have had no data on how much trash and recyclables towns in Connecticut were producing. However, despite these important developments in Connecticut’s solid waste and recycling reports, there are still limitations to the data we have been provided with; which will be explained further in the following section before I answer the question: which towns in Hartford county exhibit a high percentage of recycling relative to the total municipal solid waste produced.</p>

          <p>In your GitHub copy of this template, open the `index.html` file to see how everything must be written in HTML format. Click the pencil symbol in GithHub to edit the file. HINT: In the upper-right corner, switch the dropdown menu from `No Wrap` to `Soft Wrap` to easily view long segments of code in your screen.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a `p` tag and end with a `p` closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with `a` anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp'>W3Schools HTML Tutorial</a>.

          <p>When describing charts, maps, or tables that appear further below, refer to them "...as shown in Figure 1" or "...as shown in Table 1" and include those figure/table numbers in the titles or captions below.</p>

          <p>Embed each of your published visualizations as an HTML iframe code, following instructions in <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/embed.html'>Chapter 9 of HODV</a>, similar to the sample below.</p>

         <iframe title="Population Density of Hartford County Towns (2022)" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Z4y3B" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z4y3B/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="746" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

          <p>ADD CAPTIONS like this -- Figure 1: Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fdcm0/">interactive chart</a> AND ADD your description of the chart here. Make sure your caption includes a direct link to your published chart or map in case the embed code fails to display.</p>

          <h2>What Towns Have a High Percent of Recycling</h2>
          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future DataViz students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, such as <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/'>CT EdSight</a>, and also link to your shared Google Sheets.</p>

          <h2>Section 3</h2>
          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Environmental Protections Agency, “National Overview: Key Facts and Figures on Materials, Wastes, and Recycling”. https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#:~:text=Of%20the%20MSW%20generated%2C%20approximately,percent%20recycling%20and%20composting%20rate.</p>

          <p>“Resident Town Export.” CT.Gov EdSight, <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Resident-Town-Dashboard/Resident-Town-Export'>https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Resident-Town-Dashboard/Resident-Town-Export</a>. Accessed 29 Nov. 2022.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          <table class="tg">

              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
